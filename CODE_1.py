# Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.

# Integers and floats
num_int = 10
num_float = 3.14
#Integers can be used in arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
#They are also used in various other contexts in programming, such as indexing, counting, and looping.
x = 5
y = -10
z = 0
#In this example, x, y, and z are all integers. x is a positive integer, y is a negative integer, and z is zero.

# Strings
text = "ChatGPT is awesome!" #Note, chatgpt suggested me to say Python is awesome, which I agree but bro is 
                             #literally being my development teacher.

# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {
    "name": "Ellie", "age": 19, 
    "group": "Joel's"
    }

# Basic Operations: Python supports various arithmetic and logical operations.

# Arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b

# Logical operations
x = False
y = True
result_and = x and y
result_or = x or y
result_not = not y

# !!Indentation!! O tal do Se for e Caso nao seja.
# Indentation is crucial in Python as it defines the block of code. Use consistent indentation for code blocks.

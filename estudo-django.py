# To create a Django view for handling sign-up logic, you'll define a function in your app's views.py file. Here's an example of how you can do it:

#Open your app's views.py file.
#Define a function to handle the sign-up logic. This function should accept an HTTP request as a parameter and
#return an HTTP response.

#Inside the function, you'll typically check if the request method is POST (indicating form submission)
#and process the form data accordingly.

#You'll also render the appropriate template, either the sign-up form template or a success page template.
